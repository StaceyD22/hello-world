# hello-world
Hello all! My name is Stacey and I am an aspiring developer. My experience (professionally) is teaching, but I have spent considerable time at university and at home developing my programming skills. I am proficient in Java and progressing in Python, Javascript, and C#.I look forward to learning any skill set that helps me to improve my development skills.
